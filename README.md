# Live code challenge (Frontend)

## Overview

This is a live coding assessment for candidates applying for a Sr. frontend developer
position at Tap company.

To start the test, simply clone this repo and:

- finish all the task's requirements
- create a branch with your name (e.g "test/{{username}}")
- commit all your changes and push them to the repo

## Requirements

only we need two things:

1. Follow all TODOs and fix them.
2. complete missing test cases

## Nice to have

- Linting and pipeline setup to run unit-testing and linting on every commit
- list of recommendations to improve the codebase

Thanks!
